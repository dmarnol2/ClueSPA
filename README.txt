All 10 requirements are now satisfied with the recent implementation of "Show Record" with this last submission.

Starting new game remembers player and computer's win/loss record. Program remembers player unless he/she clicks the logout button.

All card dealings are done randomly as well which hint to display. Computer guessing is done randomly. Both player and computer remembers their"hints" given from guessing wrong. The player dropdown menu for selecting guesses is updated with knowledge gained from hint.
